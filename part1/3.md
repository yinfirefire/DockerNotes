# Rebuild with Cache

``` docker
# Use an existing dockr image as a base
FROM alpine

# Download and install dependencies
RUN apk add --update redis
RUN apk add --update gcc

#Tell the image what to do when start as a container
CMD ["redis-server"]
```

We add another line in the previous dockerfile. It will use cache to add alpine and redis, no longer need fetching. (*Sequence Matters!*, if switch redis and gcc, everything start over again.)
